# Seattle AirBnB Open Data analysis

This repository is part of the first project "Write a Data Scientist Blog Post" of the UDACITY Nanodegree "Data Scientist"

## Description of the project

The goal is to choose a dataset, point out 3-5 main questions from a given dataset, and make a basic analysis to answer
the raised questions. 
This repository covers the technical part of the analysis. The communication of the results is part of a Medium Blog Post, see https://hoseberg.medium.com/i-pack-my-ml-and-go-to-seattle-594ab48791ed

The dataset used here is the **Seattle AirBnB Open Data dataset**, see the link below for details. This dataset cotains data about hosts and accommodations in Seattle that can be booked with AirBnB. In this project, we focus on the following questions:

* What is the best location in the city to explore Seattle?
* What is the best time to travel to Seattle?
* Can we use the host's profile to see if we choose a good host?
* Can we predict the price of an accommodation based on some key indicators that are important for you?
