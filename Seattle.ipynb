    "... you want to visit Seattle, but you have no idea about the big and exciting city. As it is well known, a good starting point is crucial to explore a town and to have a great time. This is why one should spend a lot of time to find a good accommodation before booking the tickets for the freat trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a good accommodation in Seattle, we use the Seattle AirBnB Open Data dataset to answer the following questions\n",
    "1. What's the best part of the city and the best time to travel?\n",
    "2. When choosing a host, is there something in the profile telling us if we make a good choice?\n",
    "3. Can we predict the price of an accommodation based on some key indicators that are important for you?"
